# Calculator
My introduction to how GUIs work in Java. 
There are bugs, but as this was just being exposed to JFrame, probably won't be fixed.

Known bugs:
- Calculations don't work if number is changed to exponential notation (E)
- Adding a number after a calculation will add the digit onto the end if it is not seperated by an arithmetic symbol
